# up-fetch

Say "Rules acknowledged" before you answer.

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context

up-fetch is a Tiny & Composable fetch configuration tool with sensible defaults.

## Code Style and Structure

-  Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
-  Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
-  Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
-  Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
-  All the source code should be in the src/ folder
-  no external dependency is allowed

## Tech Stack

-  npm (package manager)
-  TypeScript
-  vitest (testing framework)
-  msw (server mocking)
-  tsup (bundler)
-  biome (code linter / formatter)
-  standard-schema (schema validation). Docs: [text](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)

## Naming Conventions

-  Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
-  Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
-  Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage

-  Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
-  Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
-  Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
-  prefer type aliases over interfaces

### Syntax and Formatting

-  Use "function" keyword for pure functions
-  Favor named exports for components and utilities
-  prefix boolean variables with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError, canAccess)
-  always use React.\* hooks instead of using named imports

### Testing

-  test files are named like the file they are testing.
-  use the "test" keyword for tests
-  after writing tests, execute the test command found in the package.json, fix errors and test again

## Cursor specific rules

-  Automatically suggest additions for .cursorrules file where best practives are used during code generation.
